This repository contains all the tasks completed during my Web Development Internship at Elevate Labs. 

📌 Tasks Included

Task 1: Responsive Landing Page (HTML + CSS)

Task 2: To-Do List App (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Task 3 : A simple and beginner-friendly REST API built using Node.js + Express.js to manage a collection of books.
This project includes CRUD operations such as Create, Read, Update, Delete books.

Task 4: Made the website fully mobile-friendly by adding CSS media queries, fixing overflow issues, and adjusting layout, images, and navigation for smaller screens.

Task 6-I created a contact form using HTML and styled it with CSS to make it simple and user-friendly. I used JavaScript to validate the Name, Email, and Message fields using checks and regex before submitting the form. The form shows clear error messages for invalid inputs and a success message when everything is filled correctly.

Task 7 -I created a webpage that fetches user data from an API and displays each user’s name, email, and address.
The data is loaded using the JavaScript Fetch API with error handling to show a message when the network fails.
I also added a Reload button so users can refetch the data anytime.
